[h1] Baxen's Persistence Mod [/h1]

Yes, another persistence mod.

This mod is more like a mod with persistence API mod when compared to mods like Simple Persist and RCO Persist. It is made for a campaign I am running in 2025.
I am sharing this because I like sharing my scripts, so I hope at least some of you enjoy!
